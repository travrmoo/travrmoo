Hi,

  I have always had an interest in mobile development and am always looking to further my skill set in this field. I am self taught and have a willingness to soak in and learn anything I can. I have been learning Swift as my main programming language of choice, but also enjoy exploring other languages. I have used and researched iOS app development using the programmatic method, storyboards, and SwiftUI. I've learned to set up my own GitHub and feel confident using the Git command line interface and terminal to create and maintain repositories. 

  I am an IT professional with over 10 years experience working in a large and fast paced corporate environment. I enjoy being challenged and value a position that forces me to think outside of the box to solve problems. I am a highly motivated self starter that will go above and beyond what's required of a job.
  
  Feel free to message me if you'd like to chat or have questions.
  
  Thanks,
  
  Travis
